👀 I’m interested in IT security, vulnerability management, incident response, network security, and system administration.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud security and expanding my knowledge in advanced threat hunting.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools, vulnerability management projects, and improving cybersecurity automation.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at edgar.huerta2400@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
